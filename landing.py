        On June 8th, a critical bug was found on Osmosis that led to the theft of several million dollars from liquidity pools. In an effort to help provide the Osmosis team with important data, we’ve curated these flash bounties to surface metrics that the team has requested. The upgrade that contained the exploited bug occurred at block height 4707300, and the chain was halted at block 4713064.

Of those who took advantage of the exploit, 4 entities are responsible for over 95% of the realized exploit amount.

What is the list of addresses that were explicitly exploiting the bug by doing multiple join/exits, i.e. who were the attackers? What was the total dollar amount that was taken by the attackers? What amount of stolen assets in the attackers’ wallets remain on Osmosis?
